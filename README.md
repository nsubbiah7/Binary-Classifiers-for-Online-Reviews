# Binary-Classifiers-for-Online-Reviews
 
This project uses binary classifiers to determine the sentiment of online reviews. Logistic regression, support vector machine, and neural network models are used. The original training set is split up into three parts so that there can be three different training sets. Each binary classifier is trained using one of the three resulting sets. This means that each training set has a corresponding testing set that the binary classifier can then be tested on.
